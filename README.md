# ATM-Model
ATM SIMULATOR IN PYTHON
The ATM Simulator is a simple Python project that runs in the command line. It includes a single Python file called atm.py. This project is easy to understand and use, especially for beginners.

When you start the program, it asks you to enter a username. If the username is correct, it will then ask for a PIN number. Once you enter the correct PIN, you get access to the main features of the ATM system.

You can:

Check your account statement

Withdraw money

Deposit money

Change your PIN

When you deposit or withdraw money, you just need to type the amount, and the program will show your updated balance right away. All your transactions can be viewed later in the account statement.

To change your PIN, you’ll need to enter a new one and confirm it to complete the change.

This ATM system doesn't use any database or external files to store user data. Everything – like PINs and balances – is stored directly in the code.





Username: user2

Pin code: 1234
